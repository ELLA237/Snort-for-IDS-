This repository contains the configuration, setup, and scripts for analyzing network traffic using Snort 3. 
The project aims to simulate different network attacks, assess how Snort reacts to these attacks, 
and potentially visualize the results of the logs to gain insights into system performance. 
Custom rules and configurations have been incorporated to tailor Snort's capabilities for various attack simulations.

Features

    Snort3 Configuration: Customized Snort3 setup for traffic analysis and rule management.
    Network Attack Simulations: Simulating at least 3 basic network attacks to assess Snort's performance.
    Logs and Visualizations: Analyze Snort logs and visualize results to better understand Snortâ€™s responses to various network scenarios.
    Rule Customization: Pulledpork
